    <h1>Cuttlefish</h1>

    <p>
        Cuttlefish, or <a href="#nowhere">cuttles</a>, are marine molluscs of the suborder Sepiina.
        They belong to the class Cephalopoda which also includes squid, octopuses, and nautiluses.
        Cuttlefish have a unique internal shell, the cuttlebone,
        which is used for control of buoyancy.

        The family Sepiidae, which contains all cuttlefish, inhabits tropical and temperate ocean waters.
        They are mostly shallow-water animals,
        although they are known to go to depths of about 600 m (2,000 ft).[13]
